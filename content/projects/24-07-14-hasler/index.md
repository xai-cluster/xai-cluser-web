We've received funding from the Hasler Fooundation on the project: "Towards Scalable Multimodal Causal Deep Learning: An Exploratory Study"!

**Abstract**
Contemporary deep learning (DL) models excel in approximating complex functions by discovering
fine-grained correlations among features. Yet, DL models struggle to generalize in out-of-distribution settings as
they fall short in identifying causal relationships. This small project explores the possibility to construct a
unified DL architecture supporting causal inference queries and thus producing more robust, explainable, and
generalisable predictions. This architecture will combine Retrieval Augmented Generative techniques to learn a
causal graph from the analysis of relevant scientific literature, and Deep Concept Reasoning models to infer
structural equations making the underlying causal mechanisms explicit. The project will perform a preliminary
exploration of this approach, with the aim of both testing its feasibility and drafting an SNFS grant proposal to
further develop and scale it to real-world applications.
