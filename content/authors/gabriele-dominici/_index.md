Gabriele Dominici is a PhD student specializing in artificial intelligence (AI). His research focuses on AI Safety, particularly on explainable AI (XAI) and interpretability. He aims to understand what information a model uses during its decision-making process and how to intervene and modify it to steer its behavior, allowing for the creation of models that are more aligned with human intent.
