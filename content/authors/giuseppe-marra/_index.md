I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science, KU Leuven, where I am part of the Declarative Languages and Artificial 
Intelligence (DTAI) research group. I was an FWO Post-Doc Fellow on the project “Deep Statistical Relational Learning”. 
I obtained my PhD at the University of Florence, Italy, in 2020 under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Marco Gori. 
During my PhD, I was a visiting student at KU Leuven, Belgium, and CTU Prague, Czech Republic. 
I obtained both the Bachelor and Master degrees in ICT Engineering at the University Mediterranea of Reggio Calabria, Italy.
#
My research interests are about the integration between neural computation and relational reasoning, with a particular focus 
on logical and probabilistic reasoning. Moreover, I am interested in the intersections of neural symbolic with Graph 
Neural Networks and Natural Language Processing.
