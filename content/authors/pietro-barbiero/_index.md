I am Research Assistant at the Università della Svizzera Italiana (Switzerland). 
My research activity focuses on interpretable artificial intelligence, deep learning, and 
neuro-symbolic models. 
My current projects are related to interpretable neural reasoning, 
explainable AI theory, and AI-assisted conjectures for abstract mathematics.
