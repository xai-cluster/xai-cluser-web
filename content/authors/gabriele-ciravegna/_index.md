I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the DBDMG team of Politecnico di Torino, dedicated to advancing Artificial Intelligence. 
My work focuses on making Deep Neural Networks not only more powerful but also Understandable and Trustworthy.
#
Previously, I have been working as a PostDoc in the MAASAI team of Inria at Sophia Antipolis (France), from 2022-2023. 
In 2022, I received the Ph.D. degree with honours from the University of Florence under the supervision of Professor Marco Gori. 
In 2018 I received a master’s degree in Computer Engineering with honours at the Polytechnic of Turin. Besides machine learning, 
I also like football, volleyball, and playing the piano.
