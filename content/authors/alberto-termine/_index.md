Alberto Termine is Researcher at Dalle Molle Institute of Artificial Intelligence in Lugano (CH) and Adjunct Research Fellow at Munich University of Technology, Faculty of Medicine. He got a PhD at the Logic, Uncertainty, Computation and Information Lab, with a thesis on Probabilistic Model Checking with Markov Models Semantics. Among the other, he is now interested in a variety of technical and epistemological topics related to machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence. In particular, he investigates the relationship between causality and explainability, the epistemological issues related to the use of XAI in scientific research and the role of XAI in/for education.
