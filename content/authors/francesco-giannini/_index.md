I am a researcher at the CINI (Consorzio Interuniversitario Nazionale per l’Informatica). 
My research interests mainly focus on methodologies to integrate Mathematical Logic theories and Machine Learning techniques. 
In particular, I am interested in neuro-symbolic approaches where the domain of discourse includes relational structures expressed by logical constraints, 
eventually under vague and uncertain conditions.
